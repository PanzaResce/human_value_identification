# Human Value Identification Project
This project focuses on the implementation of a BERT-based model to address the multi-label classification task of detecting human values in textual arguments. Utilizing the dataset from the "Human Value Detection 2023" challenge, our approach involves fine-tuning a RoBERTa-based model to classify arguments into categories derived from social science literature. Three models were developed, considering different parts of the arguments: conclusion, premise, and stance. The best model achieved a macro F1-score of **0.746**, demonstrating that incorporating the premise significantly enhances performance. This repository contains all the necessary code and documentation to reproduce our experiments and results.
